This python file is a part of our project for the 'IHK Berlin'. Our task is to create a display for a fictive airport to show all flights with flightnumber, cityname start, datetime start, cityname aim, datetime end
My co-partner did it with php, but I did it with the GUI-library tkinter. I needed the sql connector library for the sql connection. In python I need just one line of code to connect to the database server. The acces 
was prepared by my other co-partner. Actually I also need a TLS and a firewall for my port which was prepared by my other co-partner. There are several persons working on this project:
One for the cabling (Fritzbox etc), another for the database on mariaDB which I connected to with python and another for the DNS-Server, Firewall and the QDN www.lampedusa-airline.com

I even made an apllication on a Rasperry PI which could read this python file thanks to the integrated compiler which translated scriptcode into machine code system- and hardware independently
For this I needed to download the packages on the rasperry pi and even an utf-8 reader

Thanks for reading my code and I write me for any questions or tips
